    "## How to use these projects\n",
    "- First, read through the instructions and make sure you understand what you've read. Try to say what you read in your own words.\n",
    "- Attempt to solve it on your own without going through the YouTube tutorial or example code on Github. You'll most likely struggle. That's fine. Push yourself. This is the idea of deliberate practice from Behavioral Psychology.\n",
    "- If you haven't made any progress at all, watch the YouTube tutorial where available then look through the example code. You can also search online to see more example tutorials and Python code for the same problem.\n",
    "- After going through, go back and try to write the code by yourself without looking at the tutorial. Again, push yourself. This is grit also from Behavioral Psychology. You need it.\n",
    "- Whatever you do, do not blindly copy out the code in the tutorial, then pat yourself on the back. You may finish quickly but the reality is you haven't learned anything.\n",
    "- If you feel you're completely stuck after lots of attempts, take a break. When you step away, we know from Neuroscience research that your subconscious will continue the learning. This is because your mind has shifted from focused mode to diffused mode.\n",
    "- Whenever you solve something, celebrate it! You need the positive reinforcement to build internal references that you did it. In the future when your mind whispers “you can't do it” during a moment of doubt, you'll reply “that's not true, here's proof of what I did in the past so I can do this too”.\n",
    "- Repeat, repeat, repeat."
